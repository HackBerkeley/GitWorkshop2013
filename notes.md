# Notes from Fall 13 Workshop

    These notes are currently copied from the meeting minutes
    
* Splitting beginner and advance. Advance was good 
* Releasing instructions beforehand might not be such a good idea. Might be a natural part about how things to work. 
* People who knew basic git would have been bored (splitting was good). 
* Prevent advance people from showing up
